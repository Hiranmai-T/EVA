Target: To reduce the number of parameters to less than 10k

Result: I was able to do this, by removing conv7 block in previous step and reducing the computations slightly in 
transition block 1 and the conv block following that. Now the model has 9812 parameters.

EPOCH: 10

Test set: Average loss: 0.0207, Accuracy: 9942/10000 (99.42%)

Analysis: The model gave 99.42% accuracy in the 10th epoch. But that is the only time, the accuracy went over 99.4% 
But this is to be expected because I have reduced the number of parameters from the previous model. 
Now I have to look at different places from where I can compensate this loss of parameters
