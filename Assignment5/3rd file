Target: To try to increase the accuracy of the model and try to get 99.4% accuracy a few more times

Result: After looking at the previous logs, 
I reduced the step to 5 and lr to 0.03 in hopes of increasing the accuracy. But the result was similar to the previous model.

EPOCH: 11
Loss=0.04909350350499153 Batch_id=468 Accuracy=98.84: 100%|██████████| 469/469 [00:14<00:00, 32.79it/s]
  0%|          | 0/469 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
Test set: Average loss: 0.0195, Accuracy: 9943/10000 (99.43%)

Analysis: Maybe this is not the step which is required. I have tried the same with different optimizers like Adam but 
the results are not satisfactory.
