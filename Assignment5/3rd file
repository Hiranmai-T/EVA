Target: To try to increase the accuracy of the model and try to get 99.4% accuracy a few more times

Result: After looking at the previous logs, 
I reduced the step to 5 and lr to 0.03 in hopes of increasing the accuracy. But the result was similar to the previous model.

Analysis: Maybe this is not the step which is required. I have tried the same with different optimizers like Adam but 
the results are not satisfactory.
