Target: To look for ways to increase the accuracy further by doing data augmentation.

Result: I have used horizontal flip and the accuracy decreased.

Analysis: It was silly to use horizontal flip, as there will be no digits written in the dataset by 
flipping them, the only digit which can be flipped is 1. So this is not the data augmentation which is required.
